Simple example of PoundPay's REST API.

The example creates a Rack application that servers one page.  In that one
page, the user is presented with secure iframe served by PoundPay to pay
david@example.com $200 for a pair of Beat by Dr. Dre on our simple marketplace.

To run the example, run the command `rackup` and visit http://localhost:9292
